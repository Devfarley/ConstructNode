NPM Packages vs Modules:
NPM Packages must have a package.JSON file. 

Modules have the option of having a package.JSON file but can consist of 
just an index.js file but you must use the require() sytax to use the module. 

If you create a new Module how do you share it?
You can add it to the NPM registry (to do so you must have a package.JSON file) or share through GitHub.
